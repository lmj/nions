Nions
=====

Complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, sedenions, ..., N-ions.

This package implements these Cayley-Dickson algebras for general N.
Closed-form expressions for the corresponding operations are derived
algorithmically and translated into code.

The documentation for DEFINE-ALGEBRA and the examples at the top of
test.lisp should be sufficient for getting started.
